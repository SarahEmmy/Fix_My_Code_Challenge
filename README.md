Fix My Code
Project Overview
Welcome to Fix My Code! This project involves diving into existing code, identifying issues, and solving them. Whether you're familiar with the language or not, this challenge is designed to enhance your debugging skills.

Get started by downloading the initial files from our 0x00-Fix_My_Code_Challenge repository. Remember, it's optional, but taking on any part of this project boosts your project grade by over 100% of your average.

Background Context
Fix My Code is all about diagnosing and fixing code problems, whether it's in a known or unfamiliar language.

Requirements
Editors: vi, vim, emacs
Compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
Files end with a new line
Mandatory README.md at the project's root
Tasks
0. FizzBuzz (Advanced)
Investigate the Python FizzBuzz implementation in source code.

Issue: Incorrect output for number 15 (Fizz instead of FizzBuzz).

Possible Fix: Adjust the order of conditions for "Fizz" and "Buzz".

1. Print square (Advanced)
Review the JavaScript code to print a square in source code.

Issue: Output doesn't match expected square for certain inputs.

Possible Fix: Ensure correct loop dimensions for the square.

2. Sort (Advanced)
Examine the Ruby code for sorting arguments in source code.

Issue: Incorrect sorting of input arguments.

Possible Fix: Filter out non-numeric values before sorting.

3. User password (Advanced)
Inspect the Python User class in source code.

Issue: Unexpected test output.

Possible Fix: Verify is_valid_password function logic.

4. Double linked list (Advanced)
Analyze the C Double Linked List implementation in source code.

Issue: Output isn't as expected.

Possible Fix: Review deletion logic and handling.

Feel free to adapt this README as needed to match your project's context and style.
